This is a video game database where users can create an account, view games, wishlist games, and write reviews for games they enjoy! This site is influenced by Steam. 

## Key Features:
Users are have a library of games to view. In the navigation bar of the application, users can then add new games with title, release date, image, and price fields all being specifications for each game. Editing and deleting of games is also possible after clicking an individual game on the library page. Users can also leave reviews on each game's page and have the option to delete them as well.

## Design Improvement:
- Updated color scheme.

## Database Models:
- The user can add new games to the database through the implementation of a game schema.
